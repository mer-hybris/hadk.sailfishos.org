Sailfish OS Hardware Adaptation Development Kit
===============================================

This is a guide to help you understand how you can port Sailfish OS
to devices running CyanogenMod.

.. warning::

   Modifying or replacing your device's software may void your device's
   warranty, lead to data loss, hair loss, financial loss, privacy loss,
   security breaches, or other damage, and therefore must be done entirely at
   your own risk. No one affiliated with this project is responsible for your
   actions but yourself. Good luck.
